As a dance teacher
I want to have a schedule of my dance lessons through the day.
So I can keep track of my students and plan my lessons.  It will help me more easily manage my many dance lessons for a week.
The schedule will list our 10-12 hours the studio is open 10am - 10pm.
```

1. Create a teacher profile
2. Login as the teacher
3. Add new students that I teach
4. View all of the Dance Studio's current students.
5. Schedule a planned lesson for the current week
6. As a teacher, I can schedule a lesson with my students and fellow teachers (Noted as exchange lessons in the field, but not yet in software scope this week).
7. I can view all lessons that are active this week via the "All Lessons button"
8. If I have an active session (logged in) and go to the homepage, redirect me to my schedule view of the week.
9. Having active dates on the calendar is not supported this week.  In order to put the lessons actually on the calendar that will need to be implemented next week.
