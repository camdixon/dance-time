As a dance teacher
I want to have a schedule of my dance lessons through the day.
So I can keep track of my students and plan my lessons.  It will help me more easily manage my many dance lessons for a week.
The schedule will list our 10-12 hours the studio is open 10am - 10pm.
```

1. Create a teacher profile
2. Login as the teacher
3. Add new students that I teach
4. View all of the Dance Studio's current students.
5. Schedule a planned lesson for the current week
6. As a teacher, I can schedule a lesson with my students and fellow teachers (Noted as exchange lessons in the field, but not yet in software scope this week).
7. I can view all lessons that are active this week via the "All Lessons button"
8. If I have an active session (logged in) and go to the homepage, redirect me to my schedule view of the week.
